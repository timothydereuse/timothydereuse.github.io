I reviewed music for [The Singles Jukebox](https://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/) from 2016 until the site's closure in 2022.

For the first ever Summer of Mathematical Exposition (SOME) I made [a long video on a bottom-up method for deriving the Fourier Transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToMyB5Hk06w). People seem to like it - I mean, _I_ like it, so.

[Awful Percussion Transcriber](https://github.com/timothydereuse/awful-percussion-transcriber) is a mess of code that tries to do a very sloppy job at transcribing percussive audio into MIDI files. It is great at making vaguely rhythmic nonsense.

[Audio Slice Replacer](https://github.com/timothydereuse/audio-slice-replacer) is an earlier version of the Awful Percussion Transcriber - honestly, it is probably more interesting. It takes a source file and a destination file and tries to chop up the source and rearrange it into something that sounds like the destination, matching pieces together using a Nearest Neighbors algorithm. [Here is what it sounds like.](https://soundcloud.com/watergunsky/autechre-fleure-recreated-with-the-jlin-sample-pack-using-k-nearest-neighbors-classification?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) I have used the results of this all over my music.
