Hi. This is Tim's personal website.

I'm a PhD candidate in music technology at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. I am interested in analyzing repetition in music (pattern finding, redundancy, musical grammars), machine learning on audio and musical scores, and Carnatic (South Indian Classical) music.

I was once a "math person." In 2015 I almost tried to become an actuary but I ended up studying road networks instead.

I write music and perform under the name Water Gun Water Gun Sky Attack. You can find it online. It's at the places where music normally is.
